Registrar v1.2
    
    Modified Registrar v1.1 (Chapter 1 Assignment)
    
    This version is not pretty, but it meets specs.
    Turned in for the sake of having a working solution.
    
    As per specs: 
    - Included sorted student array in printRoster.
    - Reading student into object array already implemented.
    - Included diagrams accompany this version.
    
Registrar v2.0

    Re-structured entire program to accomodate a quasi-complete
    registry with independent student, instructor, and course
    arrays.  Course array holds a class array.  Each class holds
    a student array.  
    
    This version is neither complete nor documented and includes no
    diagrams.  Student in class functionality is missing.  Upper
    levels in th menu work.
    
    Most of my time this week was spent on this version, but I 
    couldn't complete it on time.
    
Both versions can be run from the command line using:
java -jar <filename>

For a list of command line options:
java -jar <filename> -h
